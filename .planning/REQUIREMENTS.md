## Out of Scope

Explicitly excluded. Documented to prevent scope creep.

| Feature | Reason |
|---------|--------|
| Prompt CRUD in Web App | Extension popup sufficient for prompt management, Web App focuses on team/account |
| Offline mode (v2.0) | Complex conflict handling, defer to v2.1 |
| Real-time co-editing | Overkill for text snippets, lock-based editing sufficient |
| WeChat OAuth login | Removed per user request |
| SMS verification | Costly, unreliable in China, email sufficient |
| 2FA/MFA | Overkill for ¥9/month consumer product |
| Nested teams | Complex permissions, single-level teams only |
| Team chat/messaging | Scope creep, external Slack/Discord sufficient |
| Per-seat pricing | Conflicts with flat-rate team value proposition |
| Crypto payment | Regulatory risk, traditional payment sufficient |
| AI chat integration | Scope creep, focus on prompt management |
| Community/social features | Requires moderation, dilutes focus |
